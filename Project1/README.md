I am currently a senior at the Univerisity of Akron pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
I'm actively looking for a Software Engineer internship for the Summer 2023, but currently work at Target as a part-time Fulfillment Associate.

I've mainly used C and C++ so far in my coding career, but I've also worked with SQL and Java as well.
Languages: C, C++
